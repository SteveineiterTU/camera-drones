## Commands from Lecutre:
- rqt_bag /\<bag name> (to inspect bags)
  
### Byobu
- shift + F1 help
- shift + arrows navigate through window
- alt + arrows naviaget through workspaces
- alt + shift + arrows change shape of split
- F2 new window
- shift + F2 horizontal split
- ctrl + F2 vertical split

#### Byobu Scripts:
The number (eg ${SESSION_NAME}1.1) refers to the window and sub window. So this is not a hirachy insinde of the script but it means in session take the 1. window, and the split in slot 1 (you can see those if you move around in a window)

## From my Udemy Course:
### Ros commands:
- catkin_make

- rosnode (with -h get all funcitons)
  - list
  - info /\<node name>

  - get \<\/name of parameter>
- rosbag (with -h get all functions) (nice for testing)
  - record \<name of topic>

### Good practices:
- ask yourself if a topic needs to be asynchon or not
- Services often used for calculaitons or to quickly call an action
- Have a seperate package for custom messages and services (to avoid dependency mess)
- Custom messages convention to have them PascalCase
- folder must match the name of CMakeLists (msg, srv,...)
- Have a seperate package for launch files (to avoid depenency mess)
