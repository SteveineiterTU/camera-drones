Need to run:
  https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/core/installation.html for ompl (i think by going to the ROS tab has worked the best)
  sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-dynamic-edt-3d for dynamicedt3d
  sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-octomap and add 
    find_package(octomap REQUIRED)
    include_directories(${OCTOMAP_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_ros 
      ${OCTOMAP_LIBRARIES}
    )
  to the makefile of the project. Also we need dependencies in the package.xml.
  Same for dynamicEDT3D: 
    find_package(dynamicEDT3D)
    include_directories(${DYNAMICEDT3D_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_ros 
      ${DYNAMICEDT3D_LIBRARIES}
    )

  

To run the examples of edt3d:
  - make
  - go to devel/bin and enter the file to run (eg  ./exampleEDTOctomap /home/student/camera-drones/catkin_ws/src/octomap_path_planner/maps/power_plant.bt)

Advantage of iteratrions over time:
  - We can quiete exactly say how much processpower we want to use, time could be worse in that regard. There a many other cooler metrics but its too hard for me atm to impelment xD
